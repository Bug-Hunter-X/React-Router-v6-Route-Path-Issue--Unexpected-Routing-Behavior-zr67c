# React Router v6 Route Path Issue

This repository demonstrates a peculiar issue encountered while using React Router v6.  A specific route path definition leads to unexpected routing behavior, with the component failing to render or showing unexpected results.

The `bug.js` file contains the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` illustrates the corrected implementation and an explanation.

## Problem Description
The problem lies in the definition of a particular route path within the `Routes` component.  While other paths function correctly, this specific path causes issues related to component rendering or routing logic.

## Solution
The solution involves careful examination of the path definition for potential conflicts with other routes or improper path syntax.  Detailed solution is provided in `bugSolution.js`.
